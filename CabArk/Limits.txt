TECHNICAL CAB LIMITS
====================

Max CAB unit size:  	 		4GiB - 1 byte
Max file size: 				4GiB - 1 byte
Max folder size:			2047 MiB (65535 CFDATA blocks x 32KiB)
Max folders per CAB unit:		65535 - 3
Max files per CAB unit: 		65535
Max CAB units in a set:			65535
Max item pathname size:			255

Min CAB unit size in a set:		50000 bytes


So, with a CAB set, we can store more than 65535 files using more folders and CAB units.

But we can't overcome in any way the 4GiB per-file limit, and the storable pathname limited to 255 bytes!
